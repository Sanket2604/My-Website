              <p>Hey! Welcome to my first website. This is a personal portfolio I created for myself. 
                This took me about five to six hours of coding using HTML and CSS languages. 
                This is the first webpage of a grand website. I plan to make a website which automatically creates personal webpage for people.
                 I plan to make this a trend, like everyone will have their own personal portfolio on this website.
                  Iâ€™ll add more feature make the webpage more interactive as time passes.  If you have any suggestions to share, 
                  please click on contact me on navigation bar to get in touch with me. </p>

                In the near future I see myself as a full stacks web developer.  
                Currently I have made a good progress in front end web development.
